This study presents an innovative exploration into the realm of machine learning, specifically focusing on enhancing model interpretability and 
    performance through a novel ensemble of model-based and instance-based learning approaches. Grounded in the principles of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) 
    and the Learning From Differences methodology, we introduce the \texttt{LingerRegressor} and \texttt{LingerClassifier} models with their novel variations. These models aim to leverage the strengths 
    of both learning approaches to address the limitations present in traditional machine learning algorithms, particularly in the contexts of regression and classification tasks.

    Our methodology involves a detailed examination of the algorithms' design and implementation, highlighting the integration of novel variations such as context inclusion, 
    duplication based on distance, and the addition of a distance column to further refine the learning process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the models' 
    effectiveness in achieving higher interpretability and robust performance across diverse datasets. The \texttt{LingerRegressor} and \texttt{LingerClassifier} models not 
    only offer new avenues for academic research but also practical implications for developing more transparent and efficient machine learning systems.
    
    The findings underscore the potential of blending model-based and instance-based learning to enhance machine learning models' adaptability and interpretability. 
    Future work will focus on addressing the identified limitations and exploring the applicability of our approach to broader machine learning challenges.
    This study contributes to the ongoing dialogue on improving machine learning methodologies and paves the way for further innovation in the field.
